# Edge Selection 
This repository is a part of the work completed for Ricardo Serrano's Master's thesis titled *'Edge Selection Mechanisms 
and Open Source APIs in the Context of 5G Networks'* at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in collaboration with Telefónica.

This repository aims to fill the gap in the Edge Selection API implementation defined in [CAMARA GitHub](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud/tree/main/code/API_definitions/Discovery) 
within the context of the Open Gateway initiative and Telco Edge Cloud. The main function of this API is to find the most optimal Edge Site based on the Operator Network
topology. Additionally, a version of an OAuth server has been implemented for security purposes.

## Repository Content

### 1. Edge Selection API Implementation

The core of this repository is the implementation of the Edge Selection API, which extends the functionality defined in 
the CAMARA GitHub. It provides mechanisms for efficiently selecting edges in the context of 5G networks and the Open Gateway initiative.

### 2. OAuth Server Implementation

For enhanced security measures, this repository includes a version of an OAuth server. This server is integrated into 
the Edge Selection API, ensuring secure authentication and authorization processes.

### 3. Test Scripts

Test scripts are provided in the `Testing` directory to validate the functionality of the Edge Selection API and OAuth 
server. These scripts cover various scenarios and use cases to ensure the robustness and reliability of the implementation.

### 4. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `Documentation` directory, providing detailed information on how to use 
the Edge Selection API and how it was configured for this particular project
